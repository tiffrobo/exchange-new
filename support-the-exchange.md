# Support the DSX

Your support helps the DSX continue to provide a unique service for advocacy organizations, media projects, civil rights advocates, and public figures who are working to advance social, racial, political, and economic justice in our communities and our world.

We strive to support providers for travel, accommodations, and other fees associated with DSX-related engagements. Your donation today helps us continue to provide this crucial service.

Note: Your donation is tax-deductible and will be processed by Internet Systems Consortium, our fiscal sponsor and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
